                <h3>What would you do if the boundary between you and the spirits disappeared?</h3>

                <p>There are two realms: the Mortal realm and the Spirit realm. With the faith of the gods becoming less and less important in people's lives, less people are aware of the Spirit’s realm. The separation between the Mortal realm and Spirit Realm is very thin and this unawareness is dangerous to humans and spirits who get lost between those.</p>
                <p>The Land Gods decided to make a powerful barrier that would separate these two realms. Spirits can't interact with humans and humans can’t perceive spirits. However there are exceptional occasions where this barrier gets thinner, curious spirits and unaware humans get to mingle together for the best or for the worst. <br />
                    With the tech improvements and urbanisation, even Land Gods’ power gets weaker because their power is deeply connected to the land, to Nature and people’s faith. In order to protect the balance between the Mortals and spirits, special order forces that unite the spirits and people who have the ability to see together were created.</p>
                <p>You are one of the unlucky humans that went through this barrier and ended up seeing things you shouldn’t have. Between being a college student at day, you are also working as a part timer in a sketchy detective agency that helps spirits and humans to settle conflicts born between them.</p>
